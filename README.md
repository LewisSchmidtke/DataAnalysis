# DataSciencePortfolio
This repository is used to create visually appealing plots for various datasets to be displayed in this README. As I am not a web developer and do not want to create my own website, I believe that having a separate repository showcasing my visualization skills alongside my regular programming work is a better alternative.

## Data Overview
- Global Cybersecurity Threats 2015-2024 (ONGOING) ✔️
- 2019-2024 US Stock Market Data (ONGOING) ✔️
- Credit Card Fraud Detection (Planned)

## Global Cybersecurity Threats Plots
The following plots were created to visualize different aspects of the Cybersecurity data and to be serve as insights for future business decisions.
The data consists of more than 3000 entries in 10 columns.
### 1. Cyberattack Trends:

## US Stock Market Data 2019-2024
### 1. Tech Stock Price Rolling Average:

The main idea was to first plot the stock price of the big 8 to compare any relative trends. It is clear that the overall trend for all stocks is roughly the same with dips at the beginning and end of the pandemic, overall growth during the pandemic from the "Tech Bubble" and post-pandemic growth from the AI-Boom.
### 2. Tech Stock Price vs Trade Volume:

Secondly I wanted to compare the individual tech prices with their trading volume, to analyze trading patterns. The pattern visible is that almost all tech stocks have been traded massively during the beginning of the pandemic. Certain tech stock like Apple have a very steady trading volume, while others like Nvidia have a very fluctuating trade volume. Also noticeable are the very high trade volumes during the massive dip of Neflix and Meta in 2022, while the trading volume pattern of amazon stayed relatively consistent throughout their dip.
### 3. Volatility Analysis of Crypto vs. Financial Markets

Lastly, (for now) I wanted to compare the volatility of crypto currencies compared to standard financial markets like the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 to check investment rist and overall safety when investing. It is very obvious that the financial markets have very low volatility compared to crypto currencies, with even the outliers being only a little higher than the median volatility of crypto currencies
